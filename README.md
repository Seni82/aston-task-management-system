# Task Management System


This is the group 1 project. 


We are going to be using the **BDD** as part of the process for capturing and implementing solution to this task.   


The team will come together to potential collaboratively understand the requirements and ask further questions on things that are not clear.





**Example of BDD format below for clarity:**

Title (one line describing the story)

Narrative (User story):
- As a [role]
- I want [feature]
- So that [benefit]


**Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios).** 

Scenario 1: Title
- Given [context]
- And [some more context]...
- When  [event]
- Then  [outcome] 
- And [another outcome]
